<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>The recommended way of installing Getopt.php is to use <a href="http://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>. Add it to your
<tt>composer.json</tt> file like this:</p>

{% highlight json %}
{
    "require": {
        "ulrichsg/getopt-php": "{{ site.release-major-minor }}.*"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Replace <tt>{{ site.release-major-minor }}.*</tt> by the release number you want to use (a list of releases is available on
<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/ulrichsg/getopt-php">Packagist</a>).</p>

<p>If not using Composer, you can download the desired release from GitHub and integrate it into your application manually.
Getopt.php does not have any external dependencies.</p>
