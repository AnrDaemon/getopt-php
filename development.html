<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>Getopt has received contributions from <a href="https://github.com/ulrichsg/getopt-php/graphs/contributors">several
	people</a> in the past, for which I am deeply thankful. If you would like to contribute, feel free to
	<a href="https://github.com/ulrichsg/getopt-php/issues">create an issue</a> or clone the source and submit a pull
	request. If you are planning to hack on Getopt yourself, please read the rest of this page for some general
	information.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Getopt supports PHP versions back up to 5.3, so unfortunately, all those shiny language features from newer
		versions are off limits. Luckily, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/ulrichsg/getopt-php">Travis</a> ensures this
		automatically and will notify you if your pull request does not respect it (or if it breaks anything else).</li>
	<li>With v2.0 I have adopted <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2</a> as coding conventions, so I would
		ask all contributors to adhere to it. You probably don't use it in your personal work (and neither do I), but
		it's the closest thing to a community consensus that the PHP world has, and thus I consider it appropriate for
		an open source project to use.</li>
	<li>Please supply unit tests and doc comments wherever necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the Tests</h2>

<p>If PHPUnit is already installed, calling <tt>phpunit</tt> in the project directory will run the test suite.
	However, if it is not, you can pull it in as a local dependency by running:</p>

{% highlight console %}
$ make install-dev-dependencies
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will download Composer and then run it to install Getopt's development dependencies (i.e. PHPUnit). After that,
	the test suite can be executed like this:</p>

{% highlight console %}
$ make test
{% endhighlight %}
